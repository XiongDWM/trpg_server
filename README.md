COC_ Tool for creating character and some in-game logic
#About 
first the kp(keeper) could issue a game and the system assigned a uuid for this game, players can join this game and create the character.
before game started, keeper would like to register some npc thus could interact with players, even there, keeper could import the senerio for this game is what I'm wondering.
